Working With Multiple Devices
================================

Immediately after starting the application, you will see a window for controlling a single NV200 device. 
However, the software also allows you to control additional devices.

To add more devices, click on the "Add Device" button in the main window. This will open a dialog where you can enter the connection details for the new device. Once added, you can switch between devices using the device selector in the toolbar.

Each device will have its own set of controls and settings, allowing you to manage them independently. You can also view the status and logs for each device in the main window.
